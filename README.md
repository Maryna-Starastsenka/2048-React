# 2048-React

![2048](2048.png?raw=true "2048")

2048-React is my React.js implementation of the famous 2048 game. Data is persisted through a MySQL database. This project was part of the IFT3225 course I took at Université de Montréal in 2021.

## Report

I explain how the game was thought out and implemented on the following [page](http://www-ens.iro.umontreal.ca/~starastm/ift3225/tp3/Rapport/Rapport-tp3.xhtml) (in French).
